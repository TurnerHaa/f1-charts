# f1-charts
Using rvest to web scrape [motorsportstats.com](https://motorsportstats.com/) Formula 1 race data and create bump chart visualizations of how drivers and teamed performed lap-by-lap (using gghighlight).

**Note:** This code requires semi-frequent updates to keep up with the changing structure of data on motorsport.com. 

# The brief
Running nearly every week between March and December every year, it can be difficult keeping up with every Formula 1 race. Even when you watch live, there are 20 drivers on a grid, and it's easy to miss key stories, comebacks and clashes. 

So to make it easier, I wanted to build a tool to automate the process of making simple stylish bump charts summarising each drivers position throughout a race.
